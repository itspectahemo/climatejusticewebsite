                    <h1>Bio</h1>
                    <p>Xiye Bastida is a powerful young climate activist of Mexican and Indigenous descent and her activism is 
                        rooted in her Indigenous heritage and a deep understanding of environmental justice. Her climate activism was 
                        profoundly shaped by her personal experiences, including witnessing severe flooding in her hometown and understanding 
                        the direct impacts of climate change on her Indigenous community. She has a degree in Enviromental Studies and Policy from
                        the University of Pennslyvannia. She co-founded Re-Earth Initiative, a youth-led climate 
                        organization that emphasizes intersectionality and amplifs the voices and power of youth and frontline communities.</p>
