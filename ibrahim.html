                        Hindou Oumarou Ibrahim is a prominent Indigenous rights and climate activist from the Mbororo pastoralist community in Chad.
                        As a lead advocate with the Indigenous Peoples of Africa Coordinating Committee (IPACC), she has been instrumental in bringing 
                        Indigenous perspectives to international climate negotiations, including critical presentations at many Confrence of Parties.
                        With the IPACC, Ibrahim worked on a project to 3D map Chad's Sahel desert region, combining technology and indigenous knowledge
                        of the land to help advocate for indigenous voices and for future climate change adaptation and mitigation.
                        Her message consistently emphasizes that addressing climate change requires listening to and empowering Indigenous voices, 
                        particularly those of Indigenous women who are often at the forefront of environmental stewardship.
