                        Patricia Gualinga is an Indigenous Kichwa leader from the Sarayaku community in the Ecuadorian Amazon, 
                        who has dedicated her life to defending her ancestral lands and fighting against environmental destruction. 
                        Born and raised in one of the most biodiverse regions of the world, she witnessed firsthand the devastating 
                        impacts of oil extraction, deforestation, and environmental exploitation on her Indigenous community's 
                        traditional territories. In 2012, Patricia Gualinga and the Sarayaku community were at the center of a landmark 
                        legal victory against the Ecuadorian government for human rights violations by not communicating with the Sarayaku community
                        before allowing oil exploration on their land. As a representative of her community, Gualinga travels globally to share the Sarayaku 
                        vision of "Living Forest" (Kawsak Sacha), an Indigenous concept that recognizes forests as living entities with 
                        fundamental rights.
